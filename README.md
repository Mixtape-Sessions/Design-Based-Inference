## About

Many regressions and instrumental variable (IV) specifications can be understood as leveraging the “design”
of observed shocks for credibly estimating causal effects or structural parameters. This three-day workshop
will build up this design-based toolkit and illustrate some of its advantages over alternative identification
strategies. Questions we will seek to answer include:
- "What controls do I need to include to avoid omitted variables bias?"
- "Do I need to worry about ’negative weighting’ of heterogeneous effects?"
- "How should I be clustering my standard errors?"
- "What’s the payoff to considering nonlinear/’structural’ analyses?"

The course will include two programming exercises, where different techniques will be illustrated in real-world
applications.


## Schedule

This is a three-day (9 hour) intensive workshop, with 6-7 hours of lectures and two 30-minute coding demonstrations. The remaining time will be given to breaks. The coding demonstrations will feature me going through a real-world application, which will be handed out in advance if you’d like to attempt it on your own or in small groups beforehand.
